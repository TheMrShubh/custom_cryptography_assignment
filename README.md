# Custom Playfair Cipher #

This Python Program aims at providing a tweaked version of Playfair Cipher in cryptography. This program was created as a part of the Cryptography and Security Services course in the Mumbai University. It takes the usual functioning algorithm of the Playfair Cipher and further enhances it by bringing in the concept of dynamic key generation. Further details about the algorithm are provided in the 'algorithm notes.pdf' file in the Algorithm directory.

## Prerequisites ##

* I have included a Jupyter Notebook file (.ippynb) in the 'algorithm' directory, so, you will need to install Jupyter Notebook in order to run it. Follow the link below to get Jupyter Notebook.

    https://jupyter.org/install 

## Program Output ##

The following output can be generated using the algorithm. The python code may be further enhanced by working on a structured output and input functionality.

Encryption
<pre><code>PT = "HEYO MAN"
encrypt(matrix,PT)
</code></pre>

Encryption output
<pre><code>[['KC', 'DT', 'LB', 'SC']]</code></pre>

Decryption output
<pre><code>[['HE', 'YO', 'MA', 'NX']]</code></pre>
